- I received "[2024 Tokyo Tech Award for Student Leadership](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en/news/53zhxbefz4c0)" (Sep. 19, 2024) for the following reasons:
  - Served as the 2023 representative for [Peer Supporters](https://www.siengp.titech.ac.jp/ScienceTokyo/peer/index.html), a student-run group that advises other students. Handled over 200 peer support cases with other group members throughout the academic year. With an eye on the integration with Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), made efforts to meet and exchange information with peer support groups at TMDU.
  - In addition to providing support for disaster-affected areas as a key member of [the Tokyo Tech Volunteer Group (Tokyo Tech VG)](https://www.siengp.titech.ac.jp/ScienceTokyo/vg/index.html), showed leadership skills as a member of [Taki Plaza Gardner (TPG)](https://tpgd.jp/), a student group that supports the operations at international exchange hub Taki Plaza.
- I presented the following research at [the 20th Joint Research Conference of JSIAM Research Divisions](https://jsiam.org/jsiam_archive/past_presentations/union2024/) (Nagaoka University of Technology, Niigata, Mar. 4-6, 2024).
