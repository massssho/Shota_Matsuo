- A paper on equilibrium selection via hierarchical non-cooperative game by the hybrid steepest descent method is accepted for presentation at IEEE ICASSP2025@Hyderabad (2025/1/7). 
  - **S. Matsuo**, K. Kume and I. Yamada, "Hierarchical Nash Equilibrium over Variational Equilibria via Fixed-point Set Expression of Quasi-nonexpansive Operator," arXiv:2409.11094 (to appear in IEEE ICASSP2025).
- I was awarded “2024 Tokyo Tech Award for Student Leadership” (Sep. 19, 2024).

  - The reason for the award is as follows:
    - Served as the 2023 representative for Peer Supporters, a student-run group that advises other students. Handled over 200 peer support cases with other group members throughout the academic year. With an eye on the integration with Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), made efforts to meet and exchange information with peer support groups at TMDU.
    - In addition to providing support for disaster-affected areas as a key member of the Tokyo Tech Volunteer Group (Tokyo Tech VG), showed leadership skills as a member of Taki Plaza Gardner (TPG), a student group that supports the operations at international exchange hub Taki Plaza.
